                    <strong>Gold Fashioned: A royal-style mansion made with gold moldings</strong>
                    <a href="#">This palace-style property located in Israel became a most in-demand for purchase</a>
                    <p>Its the first time for this destination to share a top ten position with anticipated leaders from California, the French Riviera, and Costa del Sol. The 5-bedroom mansion truly lives up to its name, from its palace-style exterior to Baroque interiors ornate with natural marble and onyx mosaics, monumental columns and 14-carat gold moldings. Two fountains with golden sculptures and a luxurious indoor pool give it a certain Late-Roman-Empire vibe.</p>

                    <strong>Hidden Island Road: a powerful location in New Zealand</strong>
                    <a href="#">Another surprising destination on our top list is New Zealand</a>
                    <p>Designed by award-winning architects, Mason and Wales, and recently completed by preeminent local builder Triple Star, this modern mansion offers the best of the best in design, construction, and engineering.
                    The architecture provides a direct response both to the topography of the landscape and to the incredible elevated vistas. To achieve this effect, the mansion consists of two distinct buildings linked by a translucent entry gallery. While strong in form, the house melds quietly into the landscape, providing an unbeatable outlook and privacy.</p>
